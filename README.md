Download the latest [Release](https://github.com/tidusjar/PlexRequests.Net/releases).
Extract the .zip file (Unblock if on Windows! Right Click > Properties > Unblock).
Just run `PlexRequests.exe`! (Mono compatible `mono PlexRequests.exe`)

#Configuration

To configure PlexRequests you need to register an admin user by clicking on Admin (top right) and press the Register link.
You will then have a admin menu option once registered where you can setup Sonarr, Couchpotato and any other settings.
