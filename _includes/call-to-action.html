                  <p>Ombi allows you to host your own Plex Request and user management system. </p>
                        <p>If you are sharing your Plex server with other users, allow them to request new content using an easy to manage interface!</p>
                        <p>Manage all your requests for Movies and TV with ease, leave notes for the user and get notification when a user requests something.</p>
                        <p>Allow your users to post issues against their requests so you know there is a problem with the audio etc.</p>
                        <p>Even automatically sent them weekly newsletters of new content that has been added to your Plex server!</p>
